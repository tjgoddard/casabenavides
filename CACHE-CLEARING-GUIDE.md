# Production Changes Not Showing? Cache Clearing Guide

## ✅ Your Built Files Are Correct!

The changes DID work. Built `dist/public/index.html` shows:
- ✅ GTM-TD9DT6M6 present (correct)  
- ✅ No gtag/G-TDTMB2DBTF script (removed successfully)

## The Issue: Caching

Production environments cache files aggressively. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. Clear Cloudflare Pages Cache
**In your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:**
- Go to your Casa Benavides project
- Click Settings → Builds & deployments
- Find "Purge build cache" and click it
- Trigger a new deployment

### 2. Clear Browser Cache  
**Hard refresh your browser:**
- **Chrome/Firefox (Windows):** Ctrl + F5
- **Chrome/Firefox (Mac):** Cmd + Shift + R
- **Safari:** Cmd + Option + R
- **Or use Incognito/Private mode**

### 3. Verify Deployment Settings
**Double-check these Cloudflare Pages settings:**
- Build output directory: `dist/public`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Root directory: `/` (default)

### 4. Force New Build Hash
**If still not working, make a small change to force new file hashes:**
```bash
# Add a comment to any source file, then rebuild
npm run build
```

## Quick Test
Open your production site in **Incognite mode**. If the changes show there, it's definitely a caching issue.
