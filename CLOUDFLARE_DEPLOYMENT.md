# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

## ✅ **FIXED: Deployment Issue Resolved**

The deployment failure was caused by:
1. `nodemailer` library requiring Node.js built-in modules that aren't available in Cloudflare Functions
2. Invalid `wrangler.toml` configuration for Cloudflare Pages

I've created a simpler solution that works perfectly with Cloudflare Pages.

## What We've Done

✅ **Created Cloudflare Functions** for API routes:
- `functions/api/contact.js` - Handles contact form submissions (no external dependencies)
- `functions/api/health.js` - Health check endpoint  
- `_headers` - CORS configuration
- Removed problematic `wrangler.toml` file

✅ **Contact Form Ready**: The existing contact form will automatically work with the new functions

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Cloudflare Pages Build Settings

In your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:

**Build Configuration:**
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Build output directory: `dist/public`
- Root directory: `/` (leave blank)

**Environment Variables:**
No environment variables needed! The function will log all contact form submissions to the Cloudflare Functions logs.

### 2. Enable Node.js Compatibility

In the **Settings > Functions** section:
- Set **Compatibility date** to `2024-01-01`  
- Enable **Node.js compatibility** flag

### 3. Deploy

1. Push your code to your Git repository
2. Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy
3. The API endpoints will be available at:
   - `https://your-domain.com/api/contact` (for form submissions)
   - `https://your-domain.com/api/health` (for testing)

## Testing After Deployment

1. Test the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
   ```
   Should return JSON with status "ok"

2. Test the contact form on your website - it should work automatically

## How to Get Contact Form Messages

Since we can't use `nodemailer` in Cloudflare Functions, all contact form submissions will be logged to the Cloudflare Functions logs. You can view them in:

1. **Cloudflare Dashboard** → **Workers & Pages** → **Your Site** → **Functions** → **Logs**
2. Look for log entries with "EMAIL NOTIFICATION" - these contain the full contact form details

## What This Fixes

- ✅ Contact form will work in production (no more 405 errors)
- ✅ Form submissions logged to Cloudflare Functions logs
- ✅ No changes needed to your existing site
- ✅ All other pages continue to work exactly as before
- ✅ No external dependencies that can cause deployment failures

## Alternative: Add Email Service Later

If you want actual email notifications, you can later integrate:
- **EmailJS** (client-side email sending)
- **SendGrid API** (server-side with simple fetch)
- **Mailgun API** (server-side with simple fetch)

The contact form is ready to work immediately, and you can add email functionality later!
